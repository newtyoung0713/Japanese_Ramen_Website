      <em>The history of Ramen</em>
      <article id="paragraph">
        <ol>
          <p>
            <strong>To begin with the history of ramen</strong>. There are many versions to talk about how the noodles became ramen from the ancient China to Japan; therefore, I picked some of them to share with.
          </p>
          <li>
            <strong>The first one was about six centuries ago</strong>. The original named Sutra Noodles about in Ming dynasty. However, in that moment, people rarely knew about it, until about two centuries ago that the noodles recipe was imported to Japan. Because of the earthquake in 1923, many areas got the problems, so people sold ramen by venders, and it was increased again after World War II. Day by day, about in 1958, a person sold the first instant ramen; moreover, by this event, ramen became a famous word from Japan to the whole world.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Another story was around in 1910</strong>. There was a Chinese restaurant in Tokyo sold the ramen with shoyu based broth, sliced pork, narutomaki, vegetables and seaweeds. This soup noodles combination has become a standard of Tokyo ramen. Because of it was cheap, convenient, and delicious noodles, so it has been popular soon.

          </div>
          <li>
            <strong>The third story was kind of unconstrained</strong>. The story was based on the Japanese daimyo, <strong>Tokugawa Mitsukuni</strong>, that is a famous character in Japan. He had met with a homeless who was from the Ming dynasty, and one day that the homeless named Zhiyu Zhu made one noodle soup for Tokugawa Mitsukuni. Therefore, people said he was the first person had ramen in Japan, and the ramen was based on that noodle soup.
          </li>
          <p>
            There are different stories about the history of ramen in Japan has been from a vender to a popular food in the world; furthermore, it is a classic food for Japan.
